"""Name-keyed RNG streams for reproducible runs.

One shared generator consumed in call order means every draw depends on exact
callback sequencing — determinism that cannot survive a ROS 2 executor. Here
each consumer gets a stream derived purely from ``(run_seed, name)``: adding,
removing or reordering consumers never shifts anyone else's draws. Adapted from
COOP-UAV-S ``core/rng.py``.
